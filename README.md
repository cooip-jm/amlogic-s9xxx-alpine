> [!NOTE]
> Due to the adjustment of the `/boot/vmlinuz-xxx` file size from `32MB` to `64MB` in the kernel, it is necessary to use the latest `armbian-update` script to update the kernel. Failure to do so will result in the kernel update failing and the Armbian system being unable to boot normally. Please refer to [Section 12.9](documents/README.md#129-how-to-update-service-scripts-in-the-system) of the documentation for the script upgrade method.
